- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the fr halving in css grid instead of ging each column a definite px which is difficult to get at a time. 

```html
   <div class="article-content">

   </div>
```
```css
 #article .article-content {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
    max-width: 900px;
    margin: auto;
    grid-gap: 0px 20px;
 }
```

### Continued development    

I would love to focus more on Javascript to aid my proficiency in building responsive projects.
